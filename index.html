  <p>Example of a static website. (https://www.spacejam.com/1996/) <br>
    It's static because it's written all in HTML. Every webpage is also a seperate file. I like this webpage a lot because it's a small glimpse into how the internet used to look like. <br>
    <br>
    Example of a Dynamic webpage. (https://store.steampowered.com) <br>
    It's dynamic because not only is it more complex in nature. It's making several different requests to different web servers to pull in information through various API's (I think). It's not just HTML as well. I like this because it's very simple and easy to navigate through content in here.
